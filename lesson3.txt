When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  I would like to do it everytime I can because if my hdd fails it is always backed up in the cloud

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because I may not want to pull my changes just yet or maybe Im doing something locally in another machine and an auto pull may break my file.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

   	use forks to work on a modified version of someone else's project, clone for when i want to use that repository to be synced with mine and branches, when i want to create an experimental version of the project

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It helps by knowing if you are ahead or behind the project history, if you in sync or not.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would use different files for each person all syved to google drive since it has many online tools to view different files, although github is waaaaay bettah.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Whe I do something I am not entirely sure if its gonna work in the master branch so i create a new one and then make a pull request so someone else checks if my code is viable.
    The benefits of it is that the risk of breasking the project is much lower than to work directly into the master branch because if anything goes wrong i can just go back and nothing happened,
